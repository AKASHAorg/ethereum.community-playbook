## **8.2 Technical Infrastructure & Platform Management**

Technical infrastructure can make or break a hackathon. Participants arrive ready to build—WiFi failures, missing APIs, or unclear development setups waste precious hours and kill momentum. Great technical infrastructure is invisible when working and fixable when it breaks.

### **8.2.1 Development Environment Setup**

**Network Infrastructure**

WiFi is non-negotiable. [Plan for high-density usage](https://guide.mlh.io/Organizer-Resources/Event-Logistics/Technology-Requirements.html)—every participant has 2-3 devices (laptop, phone, tablet). Test capacity before the event with realistic loads, not just a few devices. Have backup internet through mobile hotspots or secondary ISPs. Place access points strategically avoiding dead zones.

Provide sufficient power. Every table needs accessible outlets—participants can't build with dead laptops. Rent power strips if venues lack coverage. Label circuits to prevent overloads. Have extension cords and adapters on hand.

**Development Tools and Platforms**

Create standardized development environments reducing setup friction. Provide:
- **Docker containers** with pre-configured tools and dependencies
- **Cloud development environments** (GitHub Codespaces, Replit) eliminating local setup
- **Starter templates** for common project types with working examples
- **Pre-installed VMs** with required software for download

Document everything clearly. Create setup guides for different operating systems. Include troubleshooting for common errors. Record setup workshops for those who miss them. Have mentors specifically assigned to help with environment issues.

**Version Control and Collaboration**

Set up organizational GitHub/GitLab accounts where teams can create repositories. This simplifies collaboration and preserves projects after the event. Provide Git tutorials for participants unfamiliar with version control. Consider requiring repository links in final submissions—this encourages proper development practices and makes judging easier.

### **8.2.2 Cloud Platform Integration (AWS, Azure, GCP)**

**Securing Cloud Credits**

Major cloud providers offer [hackathon credits programs](https://aws.amazon.com/events/hackathons/). Apply early—approval takes weeks. AWS, Azure, and GCP each provide credits for student and community hackathons. Typical packages include $100-500 per team plus training resources.

For Ethereum hackathons, also pursue blockchain-specific infrastructure: Alchemy, Infura, or QuickNode API credits; IPFS pinning services; oracle provider access; Layer 2 testnet tokens and infrastructure.

**Distribution and Management**

Distribute credits efficiently through promotional codes or organizational accounts rather than individual applications. Create clear documentation explaining redemption, usage limits, and expiration dates. Provide cost monitoring guidance—participants shouldn't accidentally exhaust credits on misconfigured services.

Offer pre-configured cloud resources for common needs: database instances, serverless functions, container orchestration, storage buckets. This lets teams start building immediately rather than spending hours on infrastructure setup.

**Technical Workshops**

Host brief cloud platform workshops early in the hackathon covering authentication, key services relevant to expected projects, best practices for cost management, and where to find help. Keep workshops under 30 minutes—participants want to build, not sit through lectures.

### **8.2.3 Hardware Lab Management**

**Equipment Selection and Inventory**

If providing hardware, [choose carefully](https://guide.mlh.io/Organizer-Resources/Event-Logistics/Hardware-Labs.html) based on expected project types:
- **IoT hackathons**: Raspberry Pis, Arduinos, sensors, breadboards, jumper wires
- **Web3 hardware**: Hardware wallets, NFC readers, cryptocurrency ATM components
- **General**: VR headsets, cameras, microphones, mobile devices for testing
- **Electronics**: Soldering stations, multimeters, oscilloscopes (with trained supervision)

Maintain detailed inventory with unique identifiers for each item. Photograph equipment condition before lending. Create checkout systems tracking who has what. Include cables, adapters, and accessories—missing USB cables render hardware useless.

**Lending Procedures**

Establish clear checkout/return processes. Require participant IDs for equipment loans. Set return deadlines with consequences for late returns (though prioritize relationship preservation over punitive measures). Inspect equipment during returns, noting damage immediately.

Have technical staff available who understand the hardware and can help troubleshoot. Participants shouldn't struggle alone with unfamiliar equipment. Provide quick-start guides for each hardware type.

**Safety Protocols**

For any equipment requiring safety training (soldering, 3D printing, power tools), mandate brief safety demonstrations before use. Designate supervised areas for potentially dangerous equipment. Have first aid kits accessible and organizers trained in basic first response.

### **8.2.4 API Integration and Developer Resources**

**API Partner Coordination**

Work with sponsors and partners providing APIs to prepare developer resources weeks before the hackathon. Each API provider should supply:
- **Clear documentation** with working examples
- **Test credentials** or sandbox environments
- **Higher rate limits** than standard free tiers
- **On-site mentors** or Slack support during the event
- **Troubleshooting guides** for common issues

Create a centralized API catalog listing all available integrations, what they do, and how to access them. Update this continuously as partners confirm participation.

**Developer Portal**

Build a simple developer resource hub (website or wiki) containing:
- Setup instructions for all platforms and tools
- API documentation links and credentials
- Starter code repositories and templates
- Tutorial videos and workshop recordings
- Mentor contact information
- Frequently asked questions
- Real-time status page for infrastructure

Make this available before the hackathon so participants can explore and prepare. Keep it updated during the event as issues emerge or resources get added.

**Technical Mentorship**

Assign mentors with specific technical expertise: blockchain developers, cloud architects, frontend specialists, data scientists, hardware engineers. Make them easily identifiable and accessible.

Create structured help request systems—help desk, Slack channels, or ticketing tools—preventing mentors from getting overwhelmed while ensuring no requests fall through cracks. Track common issues to identify documentation gaps or infrastructure problems requiring fixes.

**Testing and Validation**

Before the hackathon, test every piece of technical infrastructure yourself:
- Can you connect to WiFi from different venue locations?
- Do API credentials work and have adequate rate limits?
- Are cloud credits redeemable and services accessible?
- Does hardware function and have required accessories?
- Are development environments complete and accessible?

Run a pre-event tech check where organizing team members try building a simple project using available resources. Any friction they encounter will frustrate participants tenfold.

**Contingency Planning**

Despite preparation, infrastructure fails. Have backup plans:
- **Alternative internet**: Mobile hotspots with adequate data
- **Offline development**: Local development servers and cached dependencies
- **API failures**: Mock services or alternative providers
- **Hardware issues**: Extra equipment and replacement parts
- **Power outages**: UPS for critical infrastructure, flashlights, clear emergency procedures

Communicate technical issues quickly and transparently when they occur. Participants understand problems happen—what frustrates them is silence and uncertainty. Have a technical lead authorized to make rapid decisions about extending deadlines or adjusting requirements if infrastructure issues consume significant participant time.

*Technical infrastructure is the foundation enabling everything else. When invisible, it lets participants focus entirely on building. When visible, it's usually because something's broken. Invest time upfront testing, documenting, and preparing—it pays dividends in participant experience and project quality.*
