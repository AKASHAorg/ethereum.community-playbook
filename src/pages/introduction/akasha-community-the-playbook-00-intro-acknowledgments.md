# Community Contributors & Acknowledgments

This playbook exists because brilliant minds chose to share their knowledge freely. What began as a vision from the AKASHA Foundation Team — who conceived this project and kick-started it — has blossomed into a collective effort spanning the global Ethereum ecosystem.

Every insight shared, resource discovered, and story told has shaped what you're reading. From seasoned community architects to first-time meetup organizers, each contributor understood that building better tools together creates stronger communities for everyone. Some contributed comprehensive guides drawn from years of experience, others shared a single powerful resource that sparked important connections.

This is our shared knowledge made tangible — a living testament that communities empowering communities can change the world.

**Thank you for building the future we all want to see.**

The following individuals have contributed their time, knowledge, and passion to make this playbook possible:
