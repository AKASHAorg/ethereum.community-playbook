# Sources & Acknowledgments

This playbook builds on a tradition of open knowledge sharing. The organizers and community builders who documented their experiences made this resource possibleâ€”their generosity enables our collective growth.

We've synthesized insights from community organizing handbooks, non-profit event management guides, tech community documentation, and Web3-native practices. Each source represents years of experimentation by communities who believed in open knowledge.

**The following resources have informed and inspired this playbook:**
