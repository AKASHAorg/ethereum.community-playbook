# 8. Hackathons

Hackathons are crucibles where ideas accelerate from concept to prototype, strangers become collaborators, and ecosystem breakthroughs emerge in compressed time. From early developer gatherings to today's blockchain build events spawning projects managing billions in value, hackathons have become essential infrastructure for innovation, talent discovery, and pushing boundaries.

But the intensity that makes hackathons transformative also makes them risky. Getting them right means balancing competition with collaboration, building with learning, and structure with creativity—all while staying true to community values.

## **8.1 Hackathon Organization & Production**

Great hackathons require months of systematic planning while remaining flexible enough to adapt when reality diverges from plans. This means understanding both universal principles and your community's specific needs.

### **8.1.1 Comprehensive Planning Guides**

**Establishing Clear Purpose**

Before booking venues or recruiting sponsors, define your hackathon's specific purpose. "Promote innovation" won't guide decisions. Ask: Are we building community among developers? Accelerating specific protocols? Creating educational opportunities? Discovering talent? Different purposes demand different designs.

Your purpose shapes everything—judging criteria, mentorship structures, success metrics, and team formation. A community-building event prioritizes collaboration differently than a competitive showcase. Be explicit early; it becomes your north star for trade-offs.

**Timeline Framework**

[Experienced organizers](https://guide.mlh.io/) emphasize that substantial hackathons need six-month planning horizons, though smaller events can compress timelines:

**Six months out**: Form organizing team with clear roles (logistics, sponsorship, participant experience, technical infrastructure, marketing, day-of coordination). Define purpose, size, format. Begin venue research and sponsor outreach. Create initial budget.

**Four to five months**: Secure venue and confirm dates—this unlocks everything else. Begin serious sponsor outreach with concrete proposals. Develop technical focus and challenge tracks. Start building marketing assets.

**Three months**: Lock major sponsors and firm up budget. Open participant registration. Recruit judges and mentors. Develop detailed schedules. Plan opening ceremonies, workshops, meals, judging logistics. Begin technical infrastructure planning.

**Two months**: Monitor registration actively. Finalize sponsor deliverables and participation. Lock judges with clear expectations. Confirm all venue logistics. Create detailed runbooks for organizing team.

**One month**: Handle final registration and send pre-event communications. Coordinate sponsor setup. Confirm all vendors and volunteers. Venue walkthrough. Prepare materials, signage, swag. Test technical infrastructure. Brief entire team.

**Two weeks**: Send detailed participant communications (what to bring, schedule, rules, team formation). Finalize food counts. Confirm judges, mentors, sponsors. Final technical testing. Create backup plans. Rest.

**During event**: Execute while staying flexible. Problems will emerge—stay visible, energetic, supportive. Monitor participant experience and adapt real-time. Document everything.

**Post-event**: Follow up on prizes. Share highlights with participants and sponsors. Thank judges, mentors, sponsors, volunteers. Gather feedback. Document lessons. Support ongoing projects and connections—this is where lasting value emerges.

**Budget Development**

[Realistic budgeting](https://guide.mlh.io/Organizer-Resources/Finance/Budget-Planning.html) prevents compromises undermining participant experience:

- **Venue**: 20-30% (university partnerships dramatically reduce this)
- **Food**: 20-30% (never skimp—hungry participants can't focus)
- **Technical infrastructure**: 10-15% (hardware, cloud credits, APIs, tools)
- **Prizes**: 15-25% (varies by model)
- **Marketing**: 5-10% (less with strong existing community)
- **Contingency**: 10-15% (for unexpected costs)

Include in-kind contributions—sponsors may provide venues, APIs, hardware, meals, or swag rather than cash. Build 10-15% contingency funds for inevitable surprises.

**Sponsorship Strategy**

[Develop packages](https://guide.mlh.io/Organizer-Resources/Sponsorship/Sponsorship-Strategy.html) offering genuine value: talent recruitment access, brand awareness, product adoption opportunities, workshop slots, or mentorship roles. Be selective—alignment matters more than money. Sponsors whose values contradict community principles undermine events regardless of funding.

Set clear expectations early. Balance sponsor visibility with participant experience—optional workshops rather than mandatory pitches, booth hours during natural breaks, mentor roles providing genuine help. The best relationships benefit participants directly.

**Participant Recruitment**

[Strategic recruitment](https://devpost.com/blog/hackathon-registration-best-practices) shapes event energy and outcomes. Decide early: open registration (broader community, lower barriers) or application-based (curated diversity, skill mix, specific experience levels).

For applications, request information that informs decisions—technical background, interests, goals—not busy work. Review holistically rather than reducing people to scores.

Prioritize diversity intentionally around gender, race, geography, educational background, experience level. Set explicit goals. Partner with organizations serving underrepresented groups. Offer travel scholarships. Create beginner-friendly tracks.

Market where desired participants are: university departments, Discord communities, Twitter, meetup groups, local news. Different channels attract different demographics—choose intentionally.

**Judging Framework**

[Thoughtful criteria](https://guide.mlh.io/Organizer-Resources/Event-Logistics/Judging.html) aligned with purpose shape what gets built. Don't judge solely on technical sophistication—this excludes beginners, designers, and domain experts. Balance technical achievement with creativity, utility, presentation, and theme alignment.

Create explicit rubrics. Rather than vague "innovation," specify what that means—novel approaches, creative framing, unexpected use cases? Define "execution"—polished demos, working code, UX quality?

Recruit diverse judges bringing different perspectives: technical experts, industry practitioners, community members, designers. Plan logistics carefully—science fair style for small events, presentation rounds for mid-size, filtering rounds for large volumes.

Consider non-competitive recognition alongside prizes: "Best use of X," "Most ambitious," "Best design," "Most likely to continue." Everyone who builds something has accomplished something worth recognizing.

### **8.1.2 Corporate and Social Impact Hackathon Models**

**Corporate Internal Hackathons**

Companies use [internal hackathons](https://www.hackathon.com/blog/corporate-hackathon-guide) to spark innovation, break silos, and explore new directions. Internal events face different constraints—participants know each other, have day jobs resuming afterward, and navigate company politics.

Design emphasizing needed outcomes: if teams never collaborate, force cross-functional mixing; if junior voices go unheard, include them in judging; if technologies need exploration, create incentive tracks.

Make space for unexpected ideas—employees understand problems invisible to management. Balance competition with collaboration carefully—politics complicate internal prizes. Schedule realistically—marathons work poorly with family obligations. Consider distributed formats across a week rather than single weekends.

**Social Impact Hackathons**

[Impact hackathons](https://www.openideo.com/articles/how-to-run-a-hackathon-for-social-good) orient building toward specific problems—climate, healthcare, inclusion, civic participation. These require different expertise: domain experts understanding problems deeply, affected community members validating solutions, designers ensuring usability, and subject specialists evaluating feasibility.

Frame challenges carefully: "How might we improve maternal health in rural areas?" invites creativity; "Build an appointment app" constrains unnecessarily. Connect participants with domain knowledge through experts who can explain nuances and pressure-test ideas.

Emphasize human-centered design and validation. Impact solutions fail when built on assumptions. Encourage participant research—interviewing users, studying existing solutions, understanding constraints. Reward thoughtful validation alongside implementation.

Plan for continuation differently. Impact projects only matter if they deploy and reach beneficiaries. Design pathways explicitly: mentorship programs, pitch opportunities to funders, connections to adopter organizations, or incubation resources.

Set appropriate expectations. Hackathons rarely solve complex social problems but can spark ideas, build prototypes proving concepts, create continuing teams, raise awareness, or demonstrate possibilities.

**Protocol Hackathons**

Web3 protocols sponsor hackathons to demonstrate capabilities, grow developer communities, discover use cases, and get feedback on developer experience. These must simultaneously educate about unfamiliar technology and enable building with it.

Invest heavily in developer experience: comprehensive documentation, clear tutorials, working examples, starter templates. Host pre-hackathon workshops teaching basics. Provide extensive mentorship from engineers who know the protocol deeply.

Design challenge tracks highlighting protocol strengths while remaining open: "Improve developer experience," "Build for underserved use cases," "Demonstrate novel capabilities." Let participants define specifics within frames.

Provide infrastructure lowering barriers: cloud credits, API keys, test tokens, development tools, hardware. Make setup frictionless—every obstacle is a team pivoting to familiar technology.

Think beyond the weekend. Teams building interesting projects are potential ecosystem contributors. Create ongoing relationships: developer grants, investor introductions, conference invitations, priority support. Successful participants often become advocates.

### **8.1.3 Student and University Hackathon Frameworks**

Student hackathons are where many developers first experience collaborative building and discover communities shaping their careers. The [university model](https://studenthackathons.com/organizer-guide/) has unique characteristics requiring adapted approaches.

**Unique Characteristics**

Student hackathons serve participants ranging from complete beginners to experienced developers, requiring broad accessibility and explicit skill-building. Many attendees have never been to hackathons, needing more guidance than experienced participants. Students lack travel budgets, making location and amenities crucial.

Universities provide venues, equipment, institutional support, and potential course integration. But academic bureaucracy creates constraints—approval processes, liability concerns, scheduling around calendars. Student organizers learn event management while executing it, with teams turning over as people graduate.

**Partnering with Major League Hacking**

[MLH partnership](https://mlh.io/organizers) provides crucial support: sanctioning bringing resources, credibility, community connection, standardized conduct codes, insurance coverage, and promotional support. Requirements ensure quality: events must be free for students, include minimum schedules and meals, follow MLH conduct codes, and meet inclusion guidelines.

The MLH community offers knowledge sharing, mentorship, and accountability networks. For first-time student hackathons, partnership dramatically lowers barriers through credibility, resources, and guidance preventing common mistakes.

**Building Beginner-Friendly Environments**

Student hackathons must welcome participants with no prior experience. Create explicit beginner tracks with scoped challenges, starter code, and achievable completion. Provide beginner-specific mentorship helping with basic questions without judgment.

Offer workshops throughout teaching fundamentals: version control, web development, API usage, project planning. Schedule early so participants can apply learning. Normalize asking questions—create visible help desks, train supportive mentors, share stories of experienced developers' early struggles.

Evaluate beginner projects appropriately. Don't compare first-time coders against experienced teams. Create separate judging or evaluate learning demonstrated. Consider "most improved," "best first project," or "most creative problem-solving" recognition.

**Facilitating Team Formation**

Students often attend solo without pre-formed teams. Structure team formation explicitly: dedicate opening time, create idea-pitching spaces, use bulletin boards or channels where people post skills and interests.

Provide frameworks helping evaluate teammates beyond coding—teams succeed through diverse skills including design, presentation, and domain understanding. Offer pre-formed team options for those overwhelmed by self-selection. Enable solo participation while encouraging collaboration.

**Building Sustainable Structures**

Document everything: runbooks covering sponsor outreach, budget planning, venue checklists, volunteer coordination, marketing timelines. Store accessibly and update after each event.

Establish clear succession: mentor younger team members into increasing responsibilities, have co-directors, start transitions before leadership changes. Build relationships transcending individual organizers—partnerships with sponsors, venues, administration that continue regardless of current students.

Connect with broader organizing community through MLH, attending other hackathons, building relationships with organizers at other universities. Balance sustainability with innovation—maintain successful traditions while empowering teams to experiment and improve.

**Connecting to Academic Programs**

Partner with departments for support: faculty offering extra credit, integrating projects into coursework, serving as mentors/judges, recruiting participants. Position hackathons as learning experiences emphasizing skills developed—teamwork, project management, working under constraints.

Create faculty research engagement opportunities. Consider credit-bearing courses combining preparation workshops, the event, and post-event development, providing structure while giving institutional recognition.
